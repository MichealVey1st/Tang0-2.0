# Tang0-2.0
A new and improved discord bot.
This is written in JS using the Discord.js library
## Tang0's story
In highschool I decided I wanted to build a discord bot. I ended up creating a simple bot that could reply if you said "!hi" as well as a couple other features. However I failed to realize at the time that because I had used Discord.py that it would quickly become obsolete. So this version is the new implementation of my first bot to be up to date with all the new features of discord. All on a upkept library for JS instead of py.
## What are these files?
- The deploy-commands files will deploy all the commands that are in commands/utility to discord so that users can use them. 
- The index.js file will be the entry point for the bot. This is the file that you run when booting up Tang0
- The config.json will be where you put your tokens and IDs used to deploy to test/global servers and run the bot.
- The files under commands/utility/*.js are the files where the commands are stored. These files can be adjusted and added onto. If you desire to create a new command you can create a .js file in that folder and it will be published like the rest.
